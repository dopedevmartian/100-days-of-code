# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 1 2020 Monday
##### (Linked Git account to Atom for ease of logging)

**Today's Progress**: Basic HTML and HTML5: Introduction to HTML5 Elements.

**Thoughts:** I struggled a bit with the internal <a> element ref# and its id="" but I figured out where it fits within the referenced id tag.  ill want to go over that again before starting
Basic HTML and HTML5: Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph.
Overall I am 39% complete with Html5

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 1: June 2 2020 Tuesday
##### (continuing HTML5)

**Today's Progress**: Basic HTML and HTML5: Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph

**Thoughts**: <a
   href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">
</a>
**This was a bit challenging as I thought the "a" anchor point was supposed to be formatted <a> ...</a>
**In this example we have " <a href="#"> ..........</a> I need to work on this a bit more to understand the attribute format
** I ended todays code on FreeCodeCamp.org at 67% Basic HTML and HTML5: Create a Form Element
** Ill pick up there tomorrow and complete that chapter :)

### Day 3: June 3 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:I completed Basic HTML and Html5 // The next section is Basic CSS which I will start tomorrow

**Thoughts** I had a little trouble wrapping labels for buttons in form elements and knowing the exact way to enclose or use self enclosing.  I did manage with some trial and error to get the jist of it after a while. My logic is that if an element has an attribute associated with it it needs self closure and then continuation to the next attribute >
So I would say today was a good day to complete all 28 sections in three days.
The entire course is called Responsive Web Design Certification.  Thats awesome and I hope to crush it
I am going to start a notebook file in order to keep the things I learn along the way and not forget them.

### Day 4: June 4 2020 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on LearnPythonTheHardWay today
Exercise 14 and 15
This dealt with making a variable prompt - prompt=">"
Also with arguments and input from the user
And lastly Reading Files into a program

**Thoughts**
Pretty straightforward today typing the exercies and breaking them down as well as manpulating them for different outputs

### Day 5: June 5 2020 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on FreeCodeCamp today
Started Introduction to Basic CSS

**Thoughts**
Today CSS made a lot of sense
basically adding a style block/ container to house all the CSS stylings in classes I create to they can be used multiple times
a class is defined as . and some name ex// .thomas-is-cool is a class then the class definition is housed in adjacent {}
thomas-is-cool can be applied to any html element by adding it appropriately

I completed 10 of 44 sections
ending with Adding Borders around Your ElementsI will pickup there tomorrow.

### Day 6: June 6 2020 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on FreeCodeCamp today
Started Basic CSS: Add Rounded Corners with border-radius

**Thoughts**
There were some easy concepts and a few ne ones like media breakpoints and html varriables
--variablename- : value
 the :root declaration was new but I do like classes and variables and the fact that this course gives you the language and examples
I need to go over each one again and supplement my notes and I need to find a way to practice on using what Im thinking of taking another day of the week to work on applying the principles I learned to my own little project
Other than that I completed basic CSS and I am moving on to APPLIED VISUAL Design
Sounds big time :)
Maybe later tonight when everyone is alseep Ill do some python too.

### Day 7: June 7 2020 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Beginning Applied Visual Design

**Thoughts**
today was a quick 105 coding of AVD because its late.
I worked on specific tags like <strong> , <u>, image:width, image height, text-align [ right, justify, center, left]
And lastly just applying tags in stype for all elements or wrapped in the p element for inline attributes


**Link(s) to work** Sample of the last page of coding :)

<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    height: 25px;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Google</h4>
      <p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were <u>Ph.D. students</u>? at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cardLinks">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page" target="_blank" class="links">Larry Page</a><br><br>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin" target="_blank" class="links">Sergey Brin</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


### Day 8: June 8 2020 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Applied Visual Design

**Thoughts**
There was a lot of animation for t his lesson and a lot of it wa s over my head.  I will need to go back top the introduction of some elements and classes to solidify those concepts and then tale my time with any animation classes within the DOM
But overall @keyframes seemed straighforward, just no the div od a rectanble or shape that housed an animation.
K later man

### Day 9: June 8 2020 Tuesday

***Today's Progress ***: LearnPythonTheHardWay
I worked on reading files again today
 Bringing in files with sys argv and input upon runing the script
 unpacking that information to the argv variable
 then opening the file object for Reading
 then reading and printing the contents to the console
 also reading the file a second time from userinput of a file filename
 LAstly closing the open Files close()
 What needs to happen is  ""<filename>.close()"
 I Initially thought to do "<close(<filename>)" incorrect :)
 So definitely learned or brought to my memory the correct way to call a method or pass a function action to
 a file.  I need to work on the input method with this exercise / study drill tomorrow!!

^^ THOUGHTS ^^:  REally good slow methodical work today
Kindle app with the book on the big screen
 and atom and python on the laptop screen in multiple desktops works pretty well :)
 Later creator

 ### Day 10: June 10 2020 Wednesday
