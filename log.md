### Day 1: June 2 2020 Tuesday
##### (continuing HTML5)

**Today's Progress**: Basic HTML and HTML5: Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph

**Thoughts**: <a
   href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back.">
</a>
**This was a bit challenging as I thought the "a" anchor point was supposed to be formatted <a> ...</a>
**In this example we have " <a href="#"> ..........</a> I need to work on this a bit more to understand the attribute format
** I ended todays code on FreeCodeCamp.org at 67% Basic HTML and HTML5: Create a Form Element
** Ill pick up there tomorrow and complete that chapter :)

### Day 3: June 3 2020 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:I completed Basic HTML and Html5 // The next section is Basic CSS which I will start tomorrow

**Thoughts** I had a little trouble wrapping labels for buttons in form elements and knowing the exact way to enclose or use self enclosing.  I did manage with some trial and error to get the jist of it after a while. My logic is that if an element has an attribute associated with it it needs self closure and then continuation to the next attribute >
So I would say today was a good day to complete all 28 sections in three days.
The entire course is called Responsive Web Design Certification.  Thats awesome and I hope to crush it
I am going to start a notebook file in order to keep the things I learn along the way and not forget them.
