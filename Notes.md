<h2>
some attributes
</h2>

When applying a CSS style directly to an element it would look like this:
<h2 style= " style argument">argument </h2>
the style attribute was in the h2 element then the h2 element was closed at the end of the line
The style attribute is embedded in the h2 tag


Adding a style block
<style> some attribute </style>
allows an attribute to be applied to all items defined within the block

A defined class can be applied to any and multiple elements directly

<p> class="red-text"
<h1> class="blue-text"
<h2> class="green-text"

color is a CSS property.......color:blue;
fontsize is a CSS property ......font-size: xxpx;
font-family is a CSS property.... font-family:  font;
